# Barro real state

This is a beautiful and cute real state agency for birds called "Barro real state". It uses nextjs for taking advantage of the server side rendering and the static site generation. It also eses SCSS for styling since styled-components doesn't support server side rendering.

You can access a live deployment of the site [here https://barro-real-state.vercel.app/](https://barro-real-state.vercel.app/).

The app isn't reponsive though, it only works on large screen as of now.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm i
# or
bun i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I used a font called "Pepper Sans", which I have the license for, but unfortunately the font weight 600 (max) is bit lighter than I would like, so I used a stroke in CSS to fake a bold font.

The logo and the design was made by me on Figma :)
